## 🔹 Topic: Sorting  
**Today’s Problem:** [1051. Height Checker](https://leetcode.com/problems/height-checker/)  

---

## 📌 Problem Summary
Given an array `heights` representing the current order of students, return the **number of indices** where the student’s height does not match the order when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.  

---

## 🛠 Concepts Used
- Sorting  
- Array comparison  
- Counting mismatches  

---

## 💡 Approach
1. Create a copy of the `heights` array.  
2. Sort the copied array.  
3. Compare each element of the original and sorted arrays.  
4. Count mismatches where values differ.  
5. Return the mismatch count.

## ⏱ Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) (due to sorting)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) (copy of the array)
