# 💻 Day 24 of #30DaysOfDSA – LeetCode Beginner Challenge

## 🔹 Topic: String Manipulation  
**Today’s Problem:** [58. Length of Last Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/)  

---

## 📌 Problem Summary
Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return the **length of the last word** in the string.  
- A word is defined as a maximal substring consisting of **non-space characters only**.  

This problem tests **string traversal**, **edge case handling with spaces**, and efficient **end-to-start scanning**.

---

## 🛠 Concepts Used
- String trimming  
- Traversal from the end  
- Built-in string functions  

---

## 💡 Approach
1. Trim trailing spaces to handle extra spaces at the end.  
2. Traverse the string from the end until a space is found.  
3. Count characters until the first space (or beginning of string) is reached.  
4. Return the count as the length of the last word.

## ⏱ Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## ✅ Takeaway
String problems often require careful handling of **spaces and edge cases**.  
Thinking from the **end of the string** is usually the most efficient approach.
